## Description

This is a mod for Farming Simulator 22, which provides a placeable bird feeder, buyable seeds and birds that will come to eat from the feeder. 

## Features

One can place a bird feeder from the construction menu, from the Animals/others category. 
Bird seed can be found from the store, objects/pallets.

Feeder is limited to one per farm.
When having added seeds to the feeder it will take a random in-game hours amount until birds spawn, and will fly around for a while in the area before landing on the feeder and starting to eat.
Birds will spawn as long as the grid used for pathfinding has been generated by the other dependency mod FS22_FlyPathfinding, generation for it takes roughly between 0-5min from loading in to the game. 
The birds will fly away after some hours if there is no seeds in the feeder.
The birds will also start flying around if the player comes too close to the feeder while they are there.

## Installation

Drop the zipped file into your FS22 mods folder as usual (Documents/My Games/FarmingSimulator2022/mods).
Drop the dependency mod FS22_FlyPathfinding also in the mods folder: https://github.com/DennisB97/FS22FlyPathfinding

## Changelog
